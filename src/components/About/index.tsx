				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I am an undergraduate Software Engineer born in the Barossa,
					South Australia with programming skills in web, desktop, and
					mobile development. I also enjoy working with electronics
					and using technologies like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I
					have loved computers ever since I could swing a keyboard and
					enjoy expanding my knowledge in as many technology fields as
					possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Engineering
					(Software) at the University of Adelaide and my expected
					graduation year is 2018.

This is repository source for my personal website. The website is hosted statically on Bitbucket. Documentation on how to do this yourself can be found [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Publishing+a+Website+on+Bitbucket).

My website is built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I take use of jQuery to handle the tabs and basic JavaScript to handle the generation of the Julia set. The Julia set is generated from the viewers ip using it as a seed for the generation of the iteration points. If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, there are CSS rules that take effect making the site usable. This website is entirely static and relies on no server-side code.

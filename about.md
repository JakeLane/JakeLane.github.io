I am an undergraduate Software Engineer born in the Barossa, South Australia with programming skills in web, desktop, and mobile development. I also enjoy working with electronics and using technologies like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I have loved computers ever since I could swing a keyboard and enjoy expanding my knowledge in as many technology fields as possible.

I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) at the University of Adelaide and my expected graduation year is 2018.
